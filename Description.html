      <h2 class="section">Description</h2>
        <p class="section">Labradors are medium-large, with males typically weighing 65–80 lb (29–36 kg) and females 55–70 lb (25–32 kg).
          The majority of the characteristics of this breed, with the exception of colour, are the result of breeding to produce a working retriever.
        </p>
        <p class="section">As with some other breeds, the Conformation (typically "Show", "English" or "bench") and the Field (typically "Working"
          or "American") lines differ, although both lines are bred in both countries. In general, however, Conformation Labradors tend to be bred
          as medium-sized dogs, shorter and stockier with fuller faces and a slightly calmer nature than their Field counterparts, which are often
          bred as taller, lighter-framed dogs, with slightly less broad faces and a slightly longer nose. However, Field Labradors should still be
          proportional and fit within American Kennel Club standards. With Field Labradors, excessively long noses, thin heads, long legs, and lanky
          frames are not considered standard. These two types are informal and not codified or standardised; no distinction is made by the AKC or
          other kennel clubs, but the two types come from different breeding lines. Australian stock also exists; though not seen in the West, they
          are common in Asia. These dogs are also very good with children.
        </p>
        <p class="section">The breed tends to shed hair twice annually or regularly throughout the year in temperate climates. Some Labradors
          shed considerably; however, individual Labradors vary. Labrador hair is usually short and straight, and the tail is quite broad and
          strong. The webbed toes of the Labrador Retriever make them excellent swimmers. The webbing between their toes can also serve as a "snowshoe"
          in colder climates and keep snow from balling up between their toes—a condition that can be painful to other breeds with hair between the toes.
          Their interwoven coat is also relatively waterproof, providing more assistance for swimming.
