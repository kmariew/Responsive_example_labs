      <h1>The History Behind Labrador Retrievers</h1>

    <section id="origins">
      <h2 class="section">Origins</h2>
        <p class="section">The modern Labrador's ancestors originated on the island of Newfoundland, now part of
          the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The founding breed of the Labrador was the St. John's
          water dog, a breed that emerged through ad-hoc breedings by early settlers of the island in the 16th century.
          The forebears of the St. John's Dog are not known but were likely a random-bred mix of English, Irish, and
          Portuguese working breeds. The Newfoundland (known then as the Greater Newfoundland) is likely a result of the St. John's Dog
          breeding with mastiffs brought to the island by the generations of Portuguese fishermen who had been fishing offshore since the
          16th century. The smaller short-coated St. John's Dog (also known then as the Lesser Newfoundland) was used for retrieval and
          pulling in nets from the water. These smaller dogs were the forebears of the Labrador Retriever. The white chest, feet, chin,
          and muzzle - known as tuxedo markings - characteristic of the St. John's Dog often appear in modern Lab mixes, and will occasionally
          manifest in Labradors as a small white spot on the chest (known as a medallion) or stray white hairs on the feet or muzzle.

      <h2 class="section">The Name</h2>
        <p class="section">The foundational breed of what is now the Labrador Retriever was known as the <i>St. John's water dog</i>,
          <i>St. John's dog</i>, or <i>Lesser Newfoundland</i>. When the dogs were later brought to England, they were named after the
          geographic area known as <i>"the Labrador"</i> (they were known as Labrador Retrievers because they <b>"retrieved"</b> in the Labrador Sea)
          or simply Labrador to distinguish them from the larger Newfoundland breed, even though the breed was from the more southern Avalon Peninsula.
        </P>
        <p class="secction">The progenitors of the Labrador retriever were actually from Newfoundland and Labrador exceptionally, the breed
          known as the <i>Newfoundland</i> was created near the same time in Labrador. The two breeds' names and origins were mixed once moved into
          England and the Americas. The dog from Labrador became the large, long-furred dog we see and know today, and the dog from Newfoundland
          became the Labrador.
